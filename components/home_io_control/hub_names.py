## @file
## @brief Shared vocabulary of the Home IO Control codegen: YAML keys and generated C++ handles.
## @ingroup hioc_codegen
##
## The ``CONF_*`` keys of the ``home_io_control:`` block and its ``oneway_controllers:`` /
## ``lr1121_firmware_update:`` sub-blocks (tuning.py keeps the ``tuning:`` keys), the
## ``home_io_control`` C++ namespace, and the class/enum handles of the hub and of the
## hub-level entities it generates. The other codegen modules import from here; this
## module imports none of them.

# Aliased: this package has its own switch.py/button.py platform submodules, so the real ESPHome
# components are always imported under names that cannot be mistaken for them. In the package's
# __init__.py an unaliased `switch`/`button` would even be overwritten: __init__.py's namespace IS
# the package object, the slot ESPHome's loader binds `esphome.components.home_io_control.switch`
# into when it imports our platform file, so whichever import ran last would silently win.
